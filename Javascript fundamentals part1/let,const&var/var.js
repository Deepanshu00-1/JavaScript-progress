// var is basically the old way of defining variables, prior to ES6.
// it's pretty much same as let.

var job = "programmer";
job = "teacher";

// we can also do this
lastName = "schmedtmann"
console.log(lastName);
// it will work but its not appropriate 
// because this doesn't create a variable in the current so called scope
