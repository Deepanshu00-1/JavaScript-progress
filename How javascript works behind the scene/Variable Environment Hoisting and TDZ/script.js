/*
Hoisting: hoisting make some type of variables accessible, or usable in the code
before they are actually declared in the code.

Before execution code is scanned for variable declarations, and for each variable,
a new property in the variable environment object

WHY TDZ?
-Makes it easier to avoid and catch errors: accesing variables before declaration
bad practice and should be avoided;
-Makes const variables actually work 

WHY HOISTING?
-Using functions before actual declaration;
-var hoisting is just a byproduct.
