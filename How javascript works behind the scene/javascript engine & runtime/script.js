// Javascript engine
// Program that executes javascript codes
// every browser has its own javascript engine but the most well known engine is Google's V-Eight

// Compilation: Entire code is converted into machine code at once, and written to a binary file that can be executed by a computer
// Interpreter: runs through the source code and executes it line by line

// Modern javascript use between compilation and interpretation called just-in-time compilation
// just-in-time: this approach basically compiles the entire code into machine code at once and then executes it right away.

// Source code -> machine code -> program running
