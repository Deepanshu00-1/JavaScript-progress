"Use strict"

/*
this keyword/variable: Special variable that is created for every execution context (every function)
Takes the value of(ports to) the 'owner' of the function in which the this keyword is used.

this is NOT static. it depends on how the function is called and its value is only assigned when the
function is actually called 

Method ðŸ‘‰ this = <Object that is calling the method>
simple function call ðŸ‘‰ this = undefined  // In strict mode! Otherwise: window(in the browser)
Arrow functions ðŸ‘‰ this = <this of surrounding function (lexical this)> // Don't get own this
Event listener ðŸ‘‰ this = <DOM element that the handler is attached to>
