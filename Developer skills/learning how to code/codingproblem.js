// reason of failing at learning how to code

// didn't have a clear goal at the beginning of his journey

// started by watching courses and reading tutorials, but he would just copy the
// the code without caring how it works. sometimes he would just copy and paste code!

// didn't reinforce what he was learning by doing small challanges or taking notes

// didn't practice coding, and didn't come up with his own ideas

// quickly became frustrated when his code was perfectly clean or efficient

// lost motivation because he thought he could never know everything

// he was learning in isolation

//  after finishing a couple of courses, he thought he now was a web developer
//  and could start applying to jobs. But he couldn't even build an app on his own!
