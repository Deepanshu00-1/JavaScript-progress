// solving problems

// example: In an array of GPS coordinates, find the two closest points

// reason of difficulty in solving problems
// 1. He jumps at the problem without much thinkng
// 2. He implements his solution in an unstructured way
// 3. He gets stressed out when things don't work
// 4. He is too proud to research solutions

//                   FIX

// 1.Stay calm and slow down, don't just jump at a problem without a plan
// 2.Take a very logical and rational approach (programming is just logic, in the end...)
// 3.Use my 4-step framework to solve any problem
// #step1. Make sure you 100% understand the problem.
// Ask the right questions to get a clear picture of the problem
// #step2. Divide and conquer: Break a big problem into smaller sub-problems
// #step3. Don't be afraid to do as much research as you have to
// #step4. For bigger problems, write pseudo-code before writing the actual code
