// 1. set a specific, measurable, realisstic and time-based goal
// know exactly why you are learning to code. Switching careers? Finding a better job?
// imagine a big project you want to be able to build!
// Research technologies you need and learn them

// 2. Understand the code that you're studying and typing
// Always type the code, don't copy paste!

// 3. After you learn a new feature or concept, use it immediately
// Take notes
// Challange yourself and practice with small coding exerises and challanges
// Don't be in a hurry to complete the course fast!

// 4. Practicing on your own is the most important thing to do
// This is NOT optional! Without practice outside of courses. 
// you won't go anywhere
// Come up with your own project ideas or copy popular sites or applications,
// or just parts of them in the beinning
// Don't be stuck in 'tutorial hell'

// 5. Don't get stuck trying to write the perfect code!
// Just write tons of code. no matter the qualiy
// Clean and efficient code will come with time
// You can always refactor code later

// 6. Embrace the fact that you will never know everything
// Just focus on what you need to achieve your goal

// 7. Explain new concepts to other people. If you can explain it,
// you truly understand it!
// Share your goals to make yourself accountable
// Share your learning progress with the web dev community
// (#100DaysOfCode, #CodeNewbie,#Webdev,etc.)

// 8. do not become overconfident after completing a course
// Courses are an amazing starting point, but are only the beginning of journey
