// so far as we learned about arrays 
// array store values and we call or use such values with their indexes

// to use values according to their names which was given by us
// objects data structure are used
// in objects, we actually define key value pairs
// so then we can give each value a name

const jonas = {
    firstName: 'jonas',
    lastName: 'schmedmann',
    age: 2037 - 1991,
    job: 'teacher',
    friends: ['michael', 'peter', 'steven']
};

// the difference between arrays and objects is
// in objects the order of these values does
// not matter at all when we want to retrieve them.
// and in arrays the order in which we specify the
// elements matters a lot because that's how we access these elements

// we should use arrays for ordered data and
// objects for more unstructured data
